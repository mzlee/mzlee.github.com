title: A day in Milan, a night in Venice
subtitle: Or, welcome to jet lag

We landed in Milan this "morning" around 7:30 am.  And by morning, I
mean a mere seven hours after taking off from JFK -- i.e., 1:30 am in
New York.  The three hour nap doesn't quite cut it for a full night's
rest, though we did actually make it through a couple of sights.

After getting out of customs and immigration, we took a train in from
MXP to Milano Cor???.  Having grabbed a couple of maps at the airport,
we knew there was some sort of park just north of the station.  It
turns out sometimes just wandering around does pay off: we managed to
stumble into the common grounds of a castle (Castello ???) and spent
the next hour or so exploring.

From the castle, we went down to the Duomo.  It was beautiful, though
unfortunately the exterior was marred by scaffolding and
advertisements.  We also walked through the San Marco church.  We
didn't really know where to go, or what to see, so we slowly worked
our way up toward the train station to Venice.  We did stop for a nice
lunch at La Cabrera.  Managed to get there right before the rush.

Now we're on a train to Venice.  Actually, we're almost there.  The
two hours were somewhat puncuated by stops, but at least we all got a
nap in.  Now let's see what a night in Venice holds!
