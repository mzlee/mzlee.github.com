subtitle: Or, the long way to Newark

Today marks the start of our trip around the world.  One might think
that traveling around the world is a daunting task (and it is).  But
when luck lands you with a cheap, one-way flight to Tokyo with a
week-long layover in Europe, you can make a pretty cool trip out of
it.

The plan is roughly as follows: leave from JFK the evening of the 25th
and fly to Milan. From there, stop in a couple of major cities in
Europe on our way to Budapest, before catching a flight from Hungary
to Japan via Amsterdam.  If all goes right (which at this point, it
has maybe been over planned), then we will pass through northern
Italy, across Austria, a dip into Budapest, a jaunt in Amsterdam, and
most of a week in Tokyo.

More as we go...
