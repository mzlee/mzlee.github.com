In a van to Chicago - this can't possibly be good for my
hands/wrists/fleshy bits.  I know I should stop and wait for more
space to work, but there's not much else to do.  I guess I should have
read while it was still light out, but now it's 5 pm and dark enough
that my non-backlit papers don't really seem feasible.

That'd be cool - paper with some form of backlight.  I guess they call
that an "e-reader", but call me old fashioned, paper is a whole lot
easier.  On the other hand, paper with some kind of glass weave so one
could either have (1) a partially see through surface, or (2) a way to
attach a light to propogate throughout.  Hmm, I'll have to file this
one away for later.

I guess in an attempt to be more interesting and to get more practice
writing, I've decided to write more.  Well, at least when I'm bored,
cramped and have no room to move...
