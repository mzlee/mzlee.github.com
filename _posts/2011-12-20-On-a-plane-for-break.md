title: On a plane for break
---

Well, it's been a while.  This site hasn't seen nearly the amount of
updates I should have liked.  Then again, I doubt it's received much
traffic.  But finally going back to the North for break.  Not that it
changes things too much.

It's funny, in theory I'm supposed to always be working, and the
wonder of computers is that I can always be working.  Never need to
leave my work at *work*, it's either in my head or just a short ssh
connection away.  But in practice, work has gone to a standstill.
It's not that I've lost interest so much as I've just found that I can
get away with not working constantly.

This is shaping up to be a fun break and a terrible two weeks when I
get back to Austin...
