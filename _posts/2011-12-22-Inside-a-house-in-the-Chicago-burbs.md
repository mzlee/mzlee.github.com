Where "consumerville" is Best Buy or CostCo or Fry's or whatever store
we're headed to today.  There's something about this season that makes
people over-eat, over-spend, over-do just about everything.  Granted,
I guess a little indulgence once a year isn't so bad.

The funny thing about this time of year is it's turned into the time
of "teach people how to play with electronics".  On the one hand, it's
sort of fun teaching someone how to use something for efficiently, but
on the other it'd be nice if the manufacturers made things more
discoverable.

It's more and more obvious when an engineer designed the interface and
more and more difficult to teach the complex actions when that's the
case...
